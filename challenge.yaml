    ## About the Automatic Terrible Machine (ATM)
    At @HACK 2025, participants hacked a dystopian ATM machine that operates on RFID cards. 
    Since this challenge requires a physical setup, we're sharing it - and the included pictures - as a fun throwback. 
    We published all utilities used to create and operate all ATM challenges [here](https://github.com/athack-ctf/chall2025-atm-rfid-utilities).
